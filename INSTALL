       include_once('extensions/SemanticNotifications/includes/SN_Initialize.php');
       enableSemanticNotifications(); 

   (3) Make sure that the statement for the gardening extension
       include_once('extensions/SemanticGardening/includes/SGA_GardeningInitialize.php');
       appears before, otherwise you might get the error

      "The extension 'Semantic Notifications' requires the extension 'Semantic Gardening'.
